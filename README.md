Recreate a basic web version of Snapchat with filters and picture gallery from camera or upload

## Intro

Objective of this project is to create a complete website that allows users to make picture montages with filters, from camera upload or file upload.

My Camagry project handles:

* User creation and authentication
* .....

### User creation and authentication

User input has been secured on front and back end with immediate feedback for front end input validation. Also password security has been taken seriously with multiple layers of complexity validated on the go, including:
* A lowercase letter
* A uppercase letter
* A number
* A minimum of 8 characters

Password will be hashed (whirlpool) first before being saved in the DB.
